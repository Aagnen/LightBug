# LightBug
An Experimental Rhino Grasshopper Plugin

LightBug is an experimental plugin and library for Rhino Grasshopper, designed as a playground for testing new ideas and techniques. As a work-in-progress project, it’s intended more for inspiration than production use—so please approach it mindfully. The LightBug is divided into two main components:

LightBugCore: The engine that tackles the problem-solving logic.
LightBugGH: The user interface layer for Grasshopper.
